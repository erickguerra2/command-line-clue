## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...

Pistas:
Go back and check the gazebo in the park

Perhaps we missed a detail in the school.

Go to the stockroom in the shops.

Check the library in the houses.

Investigation Conclusion:
The undisturbed dust patterns confirm it - you've found the crime scene! The emptiness of the room speaks volumes.
Your careful detective work has paid off. The empty state of this room matches
witness accounts - no one was around when the crime occurred. This must be
where the murderer carried out their plan!
Make sure to document this discovery in your notebook.md file along with your
other findings about the weapon and suspect.
